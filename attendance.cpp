Face Recognition Based Attendance System
-----------------------------------------
With continous observation , our Attendance system will 
come with more accuracy. We already know that the 
efficacy of Image Recognition is not very good. So our model result 
improves over a period of time with continous observation. 
Whether they are sitting at right place , their moods either interested or not
False Attendance and Proxy
Wastage of time in taking Attendance 
Statistical data is hard to analyse 

Problem with RFID Scanner :
--------------------------
Costly
False Attendance
Waiting time large

Problem with Fingerprint :
---------------------------
Fingerprint template takes a lot of space(240kB)
Costly
Waiting time is large

Face Recognition - processing is slow and facial constraints

How it will works
------------------
we need to train our model 
Detect and crop the relevant images
compare with database and update the Attendance

Technologies used :
--------------------
dlib library
Microsoft Cognitive Face API
Openpyxl
sqlite3
Implemented on Python 3.2
